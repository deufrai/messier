A very basic SQL-based version of the Messier catalog.
For more general information about the catalog and how it was first created, see : http://messier.obspm.fr/

Database contains 3 tables :

 - constellation : All existing constellations with Latin, English & French names
 - objtype       : Astronomical object types used in this catalog
 - messier       : Messier objects with J2000 coordinates, magnitude, size, name, plus references to object type and constellation

Database DDL file is aimed at MySQL, hence the InnoDB engine statements for FK uses.
Warning : Due to key constraints, the 'messier' table must be created and populated last

Except for galaxies, we use quite standard object types described by the Strasbourg astronomical Data Center. 
See : http://cds.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/Otype?IR
Galaxy types are a simplified version of Hubble's classification.

If some interest is shown, we may put up a web interface with custom queries sometime

Enjoy
