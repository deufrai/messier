A very generic SQL-based version of the Messier catalog.
See : http://messier.obspm.fr/

Database contains 3 tables :

 - constellation : All existing constellations with Latin, English & French names
 - objtype       : All astronomical object types used in this catalog
 - messier       : All Messier objects with J2000 coordinates, magnitude, size, object type and constellation

Warning : Due to key constraints, the 'messier' table must be created and populated last

Except for galaxies, we use quite standard object types described by the Strasbourg astronomical Data Center. 
See : http://cds.u-strasbg.fr/cgi-bin/Otype?IR
Galaxy types are a simplified version of Hubble's classification.


If interest is shown, we may put up a web interface with custom queries sometime

Enjoy
